## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

Hi I'm SofÃ­a, a 23 years old -still very trainee- Unity Developer from Argentina!
<p>2023 was a rough year to me due mourning, and I started 2024 feeling really down but rn (september) as late as it sounds, <br> I'm trying to reconnect with my early career that I loved so much before.</p>
<p>I've worked on University projects as a programmer, 2D pixel art artist and game designer since 2021.<br> I've been part of teams developing minigames like: </p> 
<li> âœ¨3D runner mobile game, with stacking mechanics and a small shop using user PlayerPrefs, as a programmer.</li>
<li> âœ¨A pixel art Flappy Bird inspired game, but with levels and a final boss, as a pixel artist.</li>
<li> âœ¨A  3 level, 2D, 3-match game, as a programmer and background artist.</li>
<p></p>
<p>I have basic html, css and javascript knowledge, I can code c# on Unity, I know git, github, basic and intermediate mysql queries, photoshop and aseprite. </p>

<p>ðŸŒ±Iâ€™m currently following the c# learning path from microsoft learn to refresh knowledge and solidify concepts.</p>
